create a migration to update the database:
dotnet ef migrations add <name>

The final step after creating one (or more) migrations is to actually 
apply them to the database: 
dotnet ef database update 
This command will cause Entity Framework Core to create the Items table in the database. 
If you want to roll back the database, you can provide the name of the previous migration: 
dotnet ef database update CreateIdentitySchema 
This will run the Down methods of any migrations
 newer than the migration you specify.

If you need to completely erase the database and start over, run 
dotnet ef database drop 
followed by 
dotnet ef database update 
to re-scaffold the database and bring it up to the current migration.
